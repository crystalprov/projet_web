            <p><b>Lesson summary:</b></p>
            <span class="justified">In this lesson, we explore the concept of integrals, 
                starting with the indefinite integral, which represents 
                the antiderivative of a function-essentially reversing 
                the process of differentiation. We then introduce the 
                definite integral, which calculates the area under a curve 
                between two points on the x-axis, providing a concrete way 
                to measure accumulation, such as distance or total change. 
                This is achieved by summing infinitely small rectangles 
                under the curve, a concept formalized through Riemann sums. 
                By connecting these ideas, we lay the foundation for 
                understanding how integrals describe both areas and 
                accumulated quantities, setting the stage for their 
                practical applications in mathematics and science.</span>
