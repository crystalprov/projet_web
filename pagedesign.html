                <h3>Flexbox</h3>
                <p> We chose to use Flexbox to design layouts that seamlessly adapt 
                    to various screen sizes without requiring complex calculations.
                    This approach ensures that our pages remain accessible and 
                    functional across different devices and web browsers.
                    Furthermore, the simplicity and flexibility of Flexbox make it 
                    an ideal solution for creating responsive and modern web designs.</p>

                <h3>Color palette</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>Primary Color:</h4>
                    <p>Dark Violet (#5E548E) reflects wisdom, creativity, and reliability.</p>
                    <h4>Secondary Color:</h4>
                    <p>Light Lavender (#9F86C0) offers calmness and openness, reducing anxiety.</p>
                    <h4>Background Color:</h4>
                    <p>Light Gray (#F0F0F3) creates a neutral background, highlighting important elements like text and buttons.</p>
                    <h4>Action Color:</h4>
                    <p>Vibrant Coral (#F76C6C) grabs attention and encourages important actions.</p>
                    <h4>Accent Color:</h4>
                    <p>Glacier Blue (#A8DADC) inspires tranquility and hope, supporting the idea of progress.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The colors complement each other while ensuring sufficient contrast for clear navigation.
                The palette evokes progression, professionalism, and motivation, aligning with the values of mentorship.
                We maintained a certain level of neutrality for a professional look.</p>

            <div class="about-containers">
                <h3>Form page</h3>
                <p> We used the POST method to send the information entered in the body of the HTTP request, which is more secure since it involves users' personal information.
                    We added the <i>fieldset</i> attribute to create a visual grouping of elements and ensure a well-structured form.      
                    With the addition of <i>fieldset</i>, we also included the <i>legend</i> tag for client information and the gender section. This improves accessibility for screen readers and enhances the overall visual organization.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-containers">
                <h3>Meeting page</h3>
                <p>We made a preview of the video connection feature to create a more interactive and human experience. 
                    Seeing the tutor helps enhances understanding.</p>
                <p>A schedule table displays available meeting times. This makes it easier for users to organize and book 
                    their sessions at convenient times, reducing confusion and improving overall user experience.</p>

                <h3>Our vision</h3>
                <p> We believe that learning should be accessible, enjoyable, 
                    and transformative. Our vision is to create a community where 
                    education thrives, unlocking opportunities for individuals to
